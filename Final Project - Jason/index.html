      <h2>Germany</h2>
      <p>
        During a month spanning June to July, Germany will become the epicenter
        of soccer—or rather, fußball—as it plays host to the 2024 UEFA European
        Football Championship. Taking place every four years, this tournament
        for men's national teams is set to unfold in 10 cities across Germany,
        such as Berlin, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich.
        Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor featured on T+L's A-List specializing
        in Austria and Germany, anticipates an extraordinary and unmissable
        moment, predicting soaring interest given the event's status as a major
        sports spectacle, second only to the World Cup. Even those with a
        passing interest in soccer should find the electrifying atmosphere
        captivating, especially those who chance upon game-day hotspots while
        traversing the country's rivers. Notably, Rosewood Munich takes center
        stage in one of the host cities, having opened its doors in October.
        Spanning two distinct buildings—the former headquarters of the State
        Bank of Bavaria and a Baroque residence—this 132-key property is
        conveniently located near the enchanting Old Town, including the verdant
        Maximiliansplatz. Additionally, it is within walking distance of one of
        Europe's most surprising surf destinations: the rapids of the Isar
        River.
